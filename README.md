## Open Creator Rails

Open Creator Rails is a minimal, verifiable on-chain primitive for managing access to game resources using expiration-based entitlements. The system maps `[subject, resourceId] → expirationTime` to enable creator monetization use cases like an "on-chain Patreon."

The runtime plans to include a subscription engine, core registry and issuer contracts, Unity SDK integration (with a Demo), x402 settlement adapter, payment rails extensibility framework, high-performance verifier and indexer, abstract wallet linkage, and a creator's console (MCP based).

See the initial [MVP Architecture and Design](docs/mvp-design-and-architecture.md) document for a detailed flow diagrams and architecture specifications. This is for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or core on-chan implementation and doesn't reflect the intended final product.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (forge, cast, anvil)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/) (optional) — for script usage (e.g. `get_address` in `./scripts/utils.sh` reads `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json` via jq)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd open-creator-rails
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root. Scripts load it automatically when present.

   | Variable      | Description |
   |---------------|-------------|
   | `PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key used to deploy and send transactions (e.g. `0x...`). |
   | `RPC_URL`     | JSON-RPC URL of the network (e.g. `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY` or `http://127.0.0.1:8545` for local). |

3. **Build Contracts & Sync ABIs**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @open-creator-rails/contracts build
   pnpm --filter @open-creator-rails/config sync
   ```

4. **Run Indexer (Local)**

   ```bash
   pnpm indexer:dev
   ```

5. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @open-creator-rails/contracts test
   ```

## Usage

### Deploying Registries

Deploy an AssetRegistry with the specified fee shares:

```bash
./scripts/deployRegistry.sh <creator_fee_share> <registry_fee_share>
```

| Input | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `creator_fee_share` | Share of subscription payments allocated to asset creators. Numerator for the split. |
| `registry_fee_share` | Share of subscription payments allocated to the registry. Numerator for the split. |

Example:

```bash
./scripts/deployRegistry.sh 80 20
```

Deployments are recorded in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`, where `chain_id` is the chain ID of the network from `RPC_URL` (e.g. `registries_11155111.json` for Sepolia, `registries_84532.json` for Base Sepolia). The file is an array of registry objects with `address`, `creatorFeeShare`, `registryFeeShare`, `owner`, and `assets`.

### Creating Assets

Create an asset in a registry (registry owner only):

```bash
./scripts/createAsset.sh <registry_index> <asset_id> <subscription_price> <token_address> <owner>
```

| Input | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `registry_index` | Zero-based index of the registry in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json` (e.g. `0` for the first registry). |
| `asset_id` | Human-readable identifier for the asset. The script hashes it with keccak256 to get the bytes32 used on-chain. |
| `subscription_price` | Price per subscription unit per second in the token's smallest unit. |
| `token_address` | Address of the ERC20 contract used for subscription payments. Must implement ERC-2612 (Permits), as subscription payments use gasless permit approvals. |
| `owner` | Creator/owner address of the asset; receives the creator share of subscription fees. |

Example:

```bash
./scripts/createAsset.sh 0 "default_asset_id" 4 0x1234... 0xabcd...
```

The token address must implement ERC-2612 / IERC20Permit, as subscription payments use gasless permit approvals.

New assets are appended to the `assets` array of the corresponding registry in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`. Each asset entry includes `address`, `assetId`, `assetIdHash`, `subscriptionPrice`, `tokenAddress`, and `owner`.

### Subscribe

Subscribe to an asset using ERC-2612 permit (gasless approval). The payer signs the permit and pays with tokens; the subscription is associated with a **subscriber** identity (a `bytes32` hash, e.g. `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(subscriber_id))`). The payer and the subscriber can be the same or different (e.g. "pay for someone else"). The **payer** is the address entitled to refunds if the subscription is later cancelled or revoked (unearned time is refunded to the payer).

```bash
./scripts/subscribe.sh <registry_index> <asset_id> <subscriber_id> <value> <payer_private_key>
```

| Input | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `registry_index` | Zero-based index of the registry in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`. |
| `asset_id` | Human-readable asset identifier (same string used when creating the asset). The script hashes it with keccak256 for the on-chain call. |
| `subscriber_id` | Human-readable subscriber identity (e.g. user id, wallet-derived id). The script hashes it with keccak256 to get the `bytes32` subscriber used on-chain. Access and subscription queries use this identity. |
| `value` | Payment amount in the token's smallest unit. Must be a multiple of the asset's subscription price; excess is rounded down. |
| `payer_private_key` | Private key of the token owner. Used only to sign the ERC-2612 permit (this address’s tokens are spent). The subscribe transaction is sent using `PRIVATE_KEY` from `.env`. |

Example:

```bash
./scripts/subscribe.sh 0 "default_asset_id" "user_123" 10368000 0x1b97...
```

### Set Subscription Price

Update the subscription price for an asset (asset owner only):

```bash
./scripts/setSubscriptionPrice.sh <registry_index> <asset_id> <new_subscription_price> <asset_owner_private_key>
```

| Input | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `registry_index` | Zero-based index of the registry in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`. |
| `asset_id` | Human-readable asset identifier (same string used when creating the asset). |
| `new_subscription_price` | New price per subscription unit (e.g. per second) in the token's smallest unit. |
| `asset_owner_private_key` | Private key of the asset owner. Used to send the transaction. |

Example:

```bash
./scripts/setSubscriptionPrice.sh 0 "default_asset_id" 8 0x1b97...
```

The script updates the `subscriptionPrice` for the asset in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`.

### Transfer Asset Ownership

Transfer ownership of an asset to a new address (asset owner only). The asset owner is the address that can claim the creator fee share of subscription payments.

```bash
./scripts/transferAssetOwnership.sh <registry_index> <asset_id> <asset_owner_private_key> <new_owner>
```

| Input | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `registry_index` | Zero-based index of the registry in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`. |
| `asset_id` | Human-readable asset identifier (same string used when creating the asset). |
| `asset_owner_private_key` | Private key of the current asset owner. Used to send the transaction. |
| `new_owner` | Address of the new owner; can claim creator share of subscription fees going forward. |

Example:

```bash
./scripts/transferAssetOwnership.sh 0 "default_asset_id" 0x1b97... 0xabcd...
```

The script updates the `owner` for the asset in `packages/config/src/deployments/registries_<chain_id>.json`.

> ### Test Tokens
>
> Test tokens supporting ERC-2612 (permit) are already deployed for testing subscriptions. Addresses are listed in `packages/config/src/deployments/token_addresses.json` keyed by chain ID (e.g. Sepolia `11155111`, Base Sepolia `84532`). Anyone can mint any amount for testing.
>
> **Deploy a test token** (records the address in `packages/config/src/deployments/token_addresses.json` for the current chain):
>
> ```bash
> ./scripts/deployTestToken.sh
> ```
>
> **Mint test tokens** to an address (uses the token in `packages/config/src/deployments/token_addresses.json` for the current chain):
>
> ```bash
> ./scripts/mintTestToken.sh <to> <amount>
> ```
>
> | Input | Description |
> |-------|--------------|
> | `to` | Recipient address. |
> | `amount` | Amount to mint in the token's smallest unit. |
