## Open Creator Rails

Open Creator Rails is a minimal, verifiable on-chain primitive for managing access to game resources using expiration-based entitlements. The system maps `[subject, resourceId] → expirationTime` to enable creator monetization use cases like an "on-chain Patreon."

The runtime plans to include a subscription engine, core registry and issuer contracts, Unity SDK integration (with a Demo), x402 settlement adapter, payment rails extensibility framework, high-performance verifier and indexer, abstract wallet linkage, and a creator's console (MCP based).

See the initial [MVP Architecture and Design](docs/mvp-design-and-architecture.md) document for a detailed flow diagrams and architecture specifications. This is for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or core on-chan implementation and doesn't reflect the intended final product.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (forge, cast, anvil)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/) (optional) — for script usage (e.g. `get_address` in `script/utils.sh` reads `deployments.json` via jq)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd open-creator-rails
   forge install
   ```

2. **Environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root. Scripts load it automatically when present.

   | Variable      | Description |
   |---------------|-------------|
   | `PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key used to deploy and send transactions (e.g. `0x...`). |
   | `RPC_URL`     | JSON-RPC URL of the network (e.g. `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY` or `http://127.0.0.1:8545` for local). |

   Example:

   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
   RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Build**

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

4. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

### Deploying contracts

Deploy a contract and record its address in `deployments.json`:

```bash
./script/deploy.sh "<ContractName>" "<ConstructorTypes>" <ConstructorArgs>
```

Force redeploy when the contract is already in `deployments.json`:

```bash
./script/deploy.sh -f "<ContractName>" "<ConstructorTypes>" <ConstructorArgs>
```

Example — deploy registry then token:

```bash
./script/deploy.sh "AssetRegistry" "uint256,uint256" 80 20
```

### Running scripts

Call script functions (e.g. mint, createAsset, subscribe) via:

```bash
./script/run.sh <ScriptName> "<FunctionSignature>" <args...>
```

Example:

```bash
./script/run.sh GameToken "mint(address,uint256)" <to_address> <amount>
```

To use deployed addresses in `deployments.json` from the CLI, source `utils.sh` and use `get_address`:

```bash
source ./script/utils.sh
./script/run.sh GameToken "mint(address,uint256)" $(get_address "AssetRegsitry") 1000000
```

Script names are the filename without `.s.sol` (e.g. `GameToken`, `AssetRegistry`, `Deploy`).

## RPC API Reference

All external functions for the registry and asset contracts, for use with JSON-RPC (e.g. `eth_call` for reads, `eth_sendTransaction` for writes).
